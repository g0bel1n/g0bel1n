## Lucas Saban

Student at [Ensae Paris](https://www.ensae.fr/en/). Interested in Machine Learning, Finance and more broadly in anything tech-related.

I publish some of my projects here. They were realized with the only goal of improving my ML understanding and coding skills. Thus, they are far from being perfect, so feel free to PR or e-mail me with advices !

Here are some of my projects:

* An [Image Classification project](https://github.com/iSab01/megazord-backend) using Tensoflow, Transfer-learning and CNN's. An [iOS app](https://github.com/iSab01/megazord_frontend), that I coded in swift, is the front-end part of the project. It was realized with [Augustin Cramer](https://github.com/AugustinCramer)

* A scikit-learn plugin for binary Classification tasks, delivered as a [pypi package](https://pypi.org/project/TinyAutoML/). The source is available [here](https://github.com/g0bel1n/TinyAutoML).

In a few words, it builds pipelines that handles preprocessing, feature selection, hyperparameter tuning and applies ensemble learning methods on top of it. The source code uses duck-typing, inheritance, abstract classes and fits in the global scikit-learn framework.

* An [Ant-Search Simulation](https://github.com/g0bel1n/Avengers_AntGame) with GUI using C++ and SFML

 *The ants adapt to the change in their environnement. They quickly find a new path following the pheromones tracks.*

* A data Visualization project using Geopandas : [Gravity Law Model Applied to inter-cities traffic](https://github.com/iSab01/gravlaw-model)

* A [Trading Strategy prediction project](https://github.com/iSab01/deep-FinGAF) using data image encoding, Gramian Angular Field and Convolutionnal Neural Networks.

## Lucas Saban

Student at [Ensae Paris](https://www.ensae.fr/en/). Interested in Machine Learning, Finance and more broadly in anything tech-related.

I publish some of my projects here. They were realized with the only goal of improving my ML understanding and coding skills. Thus, they are far from being perfect, so feel free to PR or e-mail me with advices !

Here are some of my projects:

* A [Trading Strategy prediction project](https://github.com/iSab01/deep-FinGAF) using data image encoding, Gramian Angular Field and Convolutionnal Neural Networks.

* An [Image Classification project](https://github.com/iSab01/megazord-backend) using Tensoflow, Transfer-learning and CNN's. An [iOS app](https://github.com/iSab01/megazord_frontend), coded in swift, is also part of the project. It was realized with [Augustin Cramer](https://github.com/AugustinCramer)

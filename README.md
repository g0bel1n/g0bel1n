# Lucas Saban

Master student at [Ensae Paris](https://www.ensae.fr/en/) and MVA (ENS Paris-Saclay). Interested in Machine Learning, Deep Learning, Swarm intelligence. 
I'm actually focusing on metaheuristic optimization technics and especially on Ant Colony Optimization. 

I open source some of my projects here. 

**Currently working on :**
* CuttinEdge : [*Computer Vision | Spatio-Temporal clustering*] based start-up for hair saloon management. Improving STDBSCAN algorithm for our use case
* MOMOA : Multi-objective Model Optimization derived from Ant colony optimization @CREST-CNRS

## Some projects


* A full-stack [Image Classification project](https://github.com/iSab01/megazord-backend) using Tensorflow, Transfer-learning and CNN's. An [iOS app](https://github.com/iSab01/megazord_frontend), that I coded in swift, is the front-end part of the project. It was realized with [Augustin Cramer](https://github.com/AugustinCramer)

* A scikit-learn plugin for binary Classification tasks, delivered as a [pypi package](https://pypi.org/project/TinyAutoML/). The source is available [here](https://github.com/g0bel1n/TinyAutoML).

In a few words, it builds **pipelines** that handles **preprocessing, feature selection, hyperparameter tuning** and applies **ensemble learning methods** on top of it. The source code uses duck-typing, inheritance, abstract classes and fits in the global scikit-learn framework.
